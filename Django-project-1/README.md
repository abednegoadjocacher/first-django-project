A sample single page

This project is a sample single page of my Django lesson.
I have study the framework Django for python and want to use the 
knowledge gain to build a single page website.
The website is more like a blog page.
I am only documenting the knowledge learnt here.

Requirements:
1. Have knowledge about Python programming.
2. Have Python installed on your machine.
3. You can have Django install globally on your machine.
