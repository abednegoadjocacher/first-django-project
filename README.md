This is my first hands on experience project built with Django framework for Python


How do you start a django project?
1. Open the folder to start your project.
2. Crete a virtual environment and activate it.
3. This is the command to create virtual environment "python -m venv 'name_environment'"
4. Install django using "pip install django".
5. Finally if the install is done you can start a project.
6. When django is install you have access to django admin utility.
7. Start a django project 'django-admin' that comes when you install Django.
8. like this "django-admin startproject 'give_your_project_name'"
9. From there you go ahead and start an app.
10. To start an app, you can use the manage.py file or the default django start app utility.
11. Here is how to start an app using the manage.py file: "python manage.py startapp 'give_your_app_name'".
12. Apps in Django are different from projects because one project can have multiple apps
