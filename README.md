This is my first hands on experience project built with Django framework for Python


How do you start a django project?
1. Open the folder to start your project.
2. Crete a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install django using "pip install django".
4. Finally if the install is done you can start a project.
5. When django is install you have access to django admin.
6. Start a django project either using the manage.py file that comes when you install Django.
7. like this "python manage.py startproject 'give_your_project_name'"
8. From there you go ahead and start an app.
9. Apps in Django are different from projects because one project can have multiple apps
