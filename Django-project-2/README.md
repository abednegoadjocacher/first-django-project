I started this project on 19th June, 2025.
The project is created for GCTU application. This is to help new applicants apply for their desire program.
I have created a virtual environment called gctu_env.
I am using Python with Django framework for the project. I chosen Python with Django for this project because of their proper documentation on how to look up for issues if you encounter any challenge. My chosen tech stack is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v5.3.3, Python, Django==5.1.7.
