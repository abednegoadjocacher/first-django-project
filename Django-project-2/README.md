I started this project on 19th June, 2025.
The project is created for GCTU application. This is to help new applicants apply for their desire program.
I have created a virtual environment called gctu_env.
I am using Python with Django framework for the project. I chosen Python with Django for this project because of their proper documentation on how to look up for issues if you encounter any challenge. My chosen tech stack is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap v5.3.3, Python, Django==5.1.7.

I got my first index file running for a test.
My next option is to create UI/UX design of the Web App. I will get my wireframe done and come back to continue.

I will also change the sqlite3 database to MySql database of my choice.
